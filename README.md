# Laptop_Price_Predictor# ðŸ’» Laptop Price Predictor





## Description

This project aims to build a machine learning model capable of accurately predicting the price of laptops based on various features.  The model utilizes a dataset of laptop specifications and prices to train and evaluate its predictive capabilities.

**Features:**

* **Data preprocessing and cleaning:** Handling missing values, outliers, and categorical features.
* **Feature engineering:** Creating new features to improve model performance.
* **Model selection and training:** Exploring various regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) and selecting the best performing one.
* **Model evaluation:** Assessing the model's accuracy using appropriate metrics (e.g., R-squared, RMSE).
* **Prediction interface:**  A user-friendly interface (potentially a web application in future versions) to input laptop specifications and receive a price prediction.


## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your_github_username>/Laptop_Price_Predictor.git
   ```
2. **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. **Install required packages:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```


## Usage

This project primarily uses Jupyter Notebooks for data analysis and model building.  After installing the necessary packages, navigate to the project directory and open the Jupyter Notebook files.

**Example (Data Preprocessing):**

```python
import pandas as pd
# Load the dataset
df = pd.read_csv("laptop_data.csv")
# Handle missing values (example)
df.fillna(method='ffill', inplace=True) 
# ... further data preprocessing steps ...
```

**Example (Model Training - Random Forest):**

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.metrics import r2_score

# ... (Data preparation and feature scaling) ...

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

model = RandomForestRegressor()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
r2 = r2_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f"R-squared: {r2}")
```
